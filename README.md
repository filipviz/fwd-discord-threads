# fwd-discord-threads

When a thread is made in one of many channels, send a notifications to many channels.

I made this to notify PeelDAO members of new bug threads in other Discord servers. Feel free to modify or use however you would like.

## Usage

1. Setup `.env` (see `.example.env`).
2. Setup `config.json`.
3. Run with `go run .`
